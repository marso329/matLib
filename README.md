# matLib
A barebone matrix library written in C

The library can be set to run in integer, single, double and quad precision mode. 

The following operations can be done:

dot product
matrix comparison
addition
subtraction
multiplication(native)
multiplication(row major optimization)
multiplication(strassen)
multiplication(strassen parallell)
determinant 
inverse
linear solver(Ax=b)
linear solver(LUx=b)
UL decomposition(Crout)
least square solver
gauss elimination
minimum of two values
row addition
transpose
sum of row
sum of column
product of row
product of column
scalar with matrix multiplication
scalar with matrix division
scalar with matrix row multiplication
scalar with matrix row division
scalar with matrix column multiplication
scalar with matrix column division
get row vector
insert row vector
switch rows
get column vector
insert column vector
switch columns
get sub matrix
insert sub matrix
copy matrix
get diagonal

And many more functions
